Project Description
The small project imports a .png as a 3-dimensional array  and then creates three matrices containing the red, green and blue values,
respectively, of each pixel in the image (from 0 to 255). Using matrix operations, and linear transformations,
we can manipulate the image matrix and use basic programing to apply a process called convolution.
